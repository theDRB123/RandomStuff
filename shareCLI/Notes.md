# Server:
    ConnectionList: 
        -> Username , IP , Hostname , WebSocket
    
    ChatRooms:
        -> RoomName 
        -> ConnectionList
        -> MessageData(JSON):
                -> Sender , Time , Message...
        -> 

# File Sharing Functionalities:
    # server will act as a mediator
    # Server will allocate the public keys to clients (the private keys will be generated by the clients themselves)
    # First a private room between the sender(s) and receiver(s) will be created
        -> Sennder sends a File Request in the room:
            [request] => fs||sender||receiver||filename||datetime
            -> Server sends the request to the receiver(s)
                -> If the receiver accepts the request:
                    -> Connection between client & receiver is established
                    -> Communication handled client to client occurs and and the file is transferred
            -> During the communication, the clients will be connected to server but server cannot see the files...


    # Admin Options:
        -> can create rooms, can remove and add clients to rooms
        -> can remove clients from the server
        -> can send a message to all clients
        -> can send a message to all clients in a room
        -> can send a message to a specific client
        -> Basic blocking and unblocking of clients


# Client Functionalities:
    # Client will be able to connect to the server
    # Client will be able to join server rooms
    # Client will be able to send messages in the server rooms
    # Client will be able to send direct messages to other clients
    # Can get a list of all rooms
    # can get a list of all clients in a room / or all the clients on the server
    # can host a private room
    # can join a private room
    # can send a file request to another client
        ->Will have end to end encryption
        ->Will utilize file compression algos
    # can accept a file request from another client
    # Can act as a server if necessary
